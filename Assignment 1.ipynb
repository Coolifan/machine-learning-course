    "One popular Agile development framework is Scrum (a paradigm recommended for data science projects). It emphasizes the continual evolution of code for projects, becoming progressively better, but starting with a quickly developed minimum viable product. This often means that code written early on is not optimized, and that's a good thing - it's best to get it to work first before optimizing. Imagine that you wrote the following code during a sprint towards getting an end-to-end system working. Vectorize the following code and show the difference in speed between the current implementation and a vectorized version.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function below computes the function $f(x,y) = x^2 - 2 y^2$ and determines whether this quantity is above or below a given threshold, `thresh=0`. This is done for $x,y \\in \\{-4,4\\}$, over a 2,000-by-2,000 grid covering that domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Vectorize this code and demonstrate (as in the last exercise) the speed increase through vectorization and (b) plot the resulting data - both the function $f(x,y)$ and the thresholded output - using [`imshow`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html?highlight=matplotlib%20pyplot%20imshow#matplotlib.pyplot.imshow) from `matplotlib`.\n",

    "4. What is the 90th percentile of $\\textbf{x}$? The 90th percentile is the value below which 90% of observations can be found.\n",

    "1 & 2. The dataset that I chose is a detailed dataset on how wide an audience the 2010 FIFA World Cup reached on television in different countries published by FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association, French for \"International Federation of Association Football\"). The dataset was further extracted and summurized by Nate Silver from fivethirtyeight.com.(Link:https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-break-fifa/)\n",
    "I am personally very interested in soccer and I have been watching every single FIFA World Cup event since 2002. FIFA World Cup 2018 will be held in Russia in this summer, and I am excited about it. The dataset mainly shows the size of TV audiences for many countries and using the dataset, we can come to some reasonable estimates of how lucrative each country’s TV market is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "country : FIFA member country\n",
    "confederation : Confederation to which country belongs\n",
    "\n",
    "population_share : Country's share of global population (percentage)\n",
    "\n",
    "tv_audience_share : Country's share of global world cup TV Audience (percentage)\n",
    "\n",
    "gdp_weighted_share : Country's GDP-weighted audience share (percentage)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3.The dataset is very clean and well-organized. There are no missing values or erroneous values. There is only one table, so no merging is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 & 5. This dataset demonstrates the distribution of global soccer fans/viewers. Specifically, wealthier countries generally have higher GDP-weighted share and higher ratio of TV audience relative to the country's total population. The majority of the audience come from Asia, Europe and South America, while North American and European countries typically have higher GDP-weighted share because of more developed economy. In total, the USA represented 11 percent of the GDP-weighted audience for the 2010 World Cup, followed by Japan (9 percent), China (7 percent), Germany (6 percent), Brazil (5 percent), and the United Kingdom, Italy and France (4 percent each). Those eight countries alone accounted for more than half of the GDP-weighted World Cup audience. In 2010, African countries represented about 25 percent of FIFA members but (even though the World Cup was played in Africa) only about 3 percent of the tournament’s GDP-weighted TV audience. By contrast, Asia and South America are underrepresented in FIFA.\n",
